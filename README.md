# Metrum-Institute
This repository holds ipython notebooks and data that port the Winbugs code used in the Metrum Institutes youtube lecture series MI250 Introduction to Bayesian PK/PD modelling into a python framework.

Specifically pymc3 is used to show the simplicty of bayesian modelling within this framework, and each notebook aims to reproduce exactly the outputs seen in the videos.

The lecture series can be found here
